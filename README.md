## Portfolio Website for John William Davis
## Web Developer | Software Developer

I am learning a lot through the GitHub tutorials. This is a place for me to chart my progress. One day at a time, a little bit each day, I am on a quest to learn software development and web development. I am changing direction in my professional life. I am teaching myself a craft and embarking on a journey of endless learning.

This will be a good place to blog and to learn - figure out things as I go. Learn GitHub as well as full stack web development, app and program development. I realize that this is a basic theme for me to work with using Jekyll, but I can concentrate on other things for now and update with more HTML and other tools later as I go on.

I will put up some images and write a little each day about my working life, and the process of going from a typical end user to a programmer. I want to capture my creativity in my technical work. That is an important balance for me.

A little bit each day . . .

Some of the resources I am using to learn are:

* [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com)

* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

* [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me)

* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

* [CodeFights](https://codefights.com)

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)

* [enki](https://www.enki.com)

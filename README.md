The Resume Website for John William Davis/Software Developer

I am learning a lot through the GitHub tutorials, and I am going to chart my progress here.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I will put up some images and write something of a blog to talk about my working life. 

A little bit each day . . . 

```markdown

#Hello World! My name is papadavis47!

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/papadavis47/papadavis47.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

title: My First Post on My New Blog
---

# I am figuring out how to use Jekyll #
## and figuring out this new blog as I go. ## 

*I am inputting this just so that I have some content of my own and I can get some practice with the "admin" function using Jekyll. Certainly better than what I had before.*

Tonight I am working with Treehouse on learning some HTML. I hope no one sees this live on the web because this is about as "newbie" as it gets.

Markdown is something I am still learning. 

We'll see how this works when I click the "create" button.

### A little bit each day. I just have to keep doing it each day. I am making a commitment to do a blog post and learn something about this site  and the tools each day. ###

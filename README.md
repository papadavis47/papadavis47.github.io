Portfolio Website for John William Davis/Software Developer

I am learning a lot through the GitHub tutorials, and I am going to chart my progress here. One day at a time, the journey to learn software programming and changing direction in my professional life is good. I am teaching myself a craft and embarking on a journey of endless learning.

This will be a good place to blog and to learn - figure out things as I go. Learn GitHub as well as web developing, app and program development as well. I realize that this is a basic themed gui type of choice for me to make, using Jekyll, but I can concentrate on other things for now and update with more HTML and other tools later.

I will put up some images and write a little each day about my working life, and the process of going from a typical end user to a software programmer. I want to capture my creativity in my technical work, also. That is an important balance for me.

A little bit each day . . . 

About me:

This is one of my first projects on Github.com.
I am a father.
I am a husband.

I am still figuring how how all of this works. We shall see.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/papadavis47/papadavis47.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

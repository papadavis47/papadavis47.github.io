The Resume Website for John William Davis/Software Developer

I am learning a lot through the GitHub tutorials, and I am going to chart my progress here.

This will be a good place to blog and learn, and figure out things as I go. GitHub as well as web developing. I realize that this is a basic themed gui type of choice for me to make, using Jekyll, but I can concentrate on other things for now and update with more HTML and other tools later.

I will put up some images and write something of a blog to talk about my working life. 

A little bit each day . . .

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/papadavis47/papadavis47.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

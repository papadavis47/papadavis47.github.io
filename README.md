<h2>Portfolio Website for John William Davis</h2>
<h2>Web Developer/Software Developer</h2>

I am learning a lot through the GitHub tutorials, and I am going to chart my progress here. One day at a time, the journey to learn software development and web development is good. I am changing direction in my professional life. I am teaching myself a craft and embarking on a journey of endless learning.

This will be a good place to blog and to learn - figure out things as I go. Learn GitHub as well as full stack web developingment, app and program development. I realize that this is a basic themed gui type of choice for me to make, using Jekyll, but I can concentrate on other things for now and update with more HTML and other tools later as I go on.

I will put up some images and write a little each day about my working life, and the process of going from a typical end user to a programmer. I want to capture my creativity in my technical work. That is an important balance for me.

A little bit each day . . .

I am still figuring how how all of this works. We shall see.
